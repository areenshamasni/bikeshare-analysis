# Bikeshare Data Analysis

This project explores and analyzes bikeshare data from multiple cities using Python and Flask. It provides insights into various statistics such as popular stations, trip durations, user demographics, and more.

## Overview

The project uses Python along with Flask framework for building a web application to explore and visualize bikeshare data. The data is sourced from CSV files for cities like Chicago, New York City, and Washington.

## Features

- **Data Exploration:** Filter data by city, month, and day of the week to explore bikeshare usage patterns.
- **Statistics:** Calculate and display statistics such as most popular stations, trip durations, and user demographics.
- **Visualization:** Visualize data trends using charts and graphs (not implemented yet in this example).

## How to Use Flask App

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd bikeshare-analysis
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install Flask pandas Werkzeug
   ```
3. **Run the Flask application:**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

4. **Open your web browser:**
   Navigate to `http://localhost:5000` to explore the bikeshare data interactively.
   
## How to Use Terminal app
  1. **Run the Terminal application:**
   ```bash
   python bikeshare.py
   ```

## Files Included

- `app.py`: Flask application to handle web requests and data processing.
- `templates/`: HTML templates for rendering the web interface.
